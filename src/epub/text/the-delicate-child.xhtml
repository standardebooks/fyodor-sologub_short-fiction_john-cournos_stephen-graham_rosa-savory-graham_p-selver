			<h2 epub:type="title">The Delicate Child</h2>
			<p>There once lived a delicate child.</p>
			<p>When he was born they put him in a glass bell-jar, so that flies should not torment him.</p>
			<p>So he lived in the bell-jar.</p>
			<p>The boy looked out through the glass and saw the birch tree shaking in the wind. But he did not know that it was from the wind, the delicate boy did not know.</p>
			<p>And he cried out to the birch tree:</p>
			<p>“Don’t shake, stupid birch, you’ll break yourself.”</p>
			<p>The wind ceased to blow and the birch became still. And the delicate boy was very pleased, and so cried out:</p>
			<p>“That’s a sensible tree, I’m glad you listened to me.”</p>
