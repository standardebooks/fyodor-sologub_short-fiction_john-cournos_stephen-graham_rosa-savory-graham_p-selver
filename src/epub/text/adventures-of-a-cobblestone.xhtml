			<h2 epub:type="title">Adventures of a Cobblestone</h2>
			<p>There was in the town a cobbled roadway. A wheel of a passing cart loosened one of the stones. The stone said to himself, “Why should I lie here close packed with others of my kind? I will live separately.”</p>
			<p>A boy came along and picked up the cobblestone.</p>
			<p>Thought the stone to himself: “I wanted to travel and I travel. I only had to wish sufficiently strongly.”</p>
			<p>The boy threw the stone at a house. Thought the stone: “I wish to fly and I fly. It’s quite simple⁠—I just willed it.”</p>
			<p>Bang went the stone against the window-glass. The glass broke and in doing so cried out:</p>
			<p>“Oh, you scoundrel! What are you doing?”</p>
			<p>But the stone replied:</p>
			<p>“You’d have done better to get out of the way. I don’t like people getting in my way. Everything arranged for my benefit⁠—that’s my motto.”</p>
			<p>The stone fell on a soft bed and thought: “I’ve flown a bit, and now I’ll lie down for a while and rest.”</p>
			<p>A servant came and took the stone off the bed and threw it out at the window again so that it fell back on the cobbled roadway.</p>
			<p>Then the stone cried out to his fellow-cobbles: “Brothers, good health, I’ve just been paying a call at one of the mansions, but I did not at all care for the aristocracy, my heart yearned for the common people, so I returned.”</p>
