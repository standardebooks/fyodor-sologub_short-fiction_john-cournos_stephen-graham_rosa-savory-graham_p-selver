			<h2 epub:type="title">The Bull</h2>
			<p>A little boy had a mama who wore light blue spectacles and a papa who wore dark blue ones.</p>
			<p>They weighed in a pair of scales all that the little boy ate, meat, bread, milk, weighed it all.</p>
			<p>At last, one day, papa said to mama: “Our boy has today finished his first bull, tomorrow he starts on his second.”</p>
			<p>When the little boy heard this he began to cry, and he said:</p>
			<p>“I don’t want to eat a bull⁠—a bull has got horns.”</p>
