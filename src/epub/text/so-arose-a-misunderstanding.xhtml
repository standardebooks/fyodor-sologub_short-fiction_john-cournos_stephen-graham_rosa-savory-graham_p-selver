			<h2 epub:type="title">So Arose a Misunderstanding</h2>
			<p>A boy once asked:</p>
			<p>“What is coming?”</p>
			<p>“I don’t know,” said his mother.</p>
			<p>“But I know,” said the boy.</p>
			<p>“What?” asked the mother.</p>
			<p>The boy laughed and answered:</p>
			<p>“I shan’t say.”</p>
			<p>Mother got angry, complained to papa. Papa cried out:</p>
			<p>“What are you laughing about?”</p>
			<p>“What?” said the little boy.</p>
			<p>“Insulting your mother! What do you know?”</p>
			<p>The boy went pale and answered:</p>
			<p>“I don’t know anything. I was joking.”</p>
			<p>Papa got more and more angry. He thought the boy knew something, so he bellowed at him in a dreadful voice:</p>
			<p>“Say out what you know! Say what is coming!”</p>
			<p>The boy began to cry and could not say what was coming.</p>
			<p>In that way arose a misunderstanding.</p>
