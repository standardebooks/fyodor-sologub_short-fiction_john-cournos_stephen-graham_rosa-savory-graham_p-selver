			<h2 epub:type="title">The Affectionate Boy</h2>
			<p>Sasha loved sweets.</p>
			<p>But his mother did not give him many sweets in order not to spoil his teeth.</p>
			<p>He thought of a way of begging some from her⁠—he knew that she had some bonbons, and so he would begin to kiss her and coax her:</p>
			<p>“You are my sweet little bonbon, my handsome little bonbon.”</p>
			<p>His mother would laugh and give Sasha a bonbon.</p>
			<p>Once his pockmarked uncle came and brought some honey-cakes. Sasha got up on his knees, and said coaxingly:</p>
			<p>“You are my lovely little honey-cake, my handsome little honey-cake!”</p>
			<p>But the pockmarked uncle replied:</p>
			<p>“I don’t like little beggars.”</p>
			<p>And he put the honey-cakes back into his pocket.</p>
