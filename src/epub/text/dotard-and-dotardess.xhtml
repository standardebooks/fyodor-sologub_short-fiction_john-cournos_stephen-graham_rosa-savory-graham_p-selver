			<p>There once lived an old dotard and old dotardess.</p>
			<p>The dotard had lived five hundred years, the dotardess four hundred.</p>
			<p>The dotard received a big pension, and gave it to the dotardess for expenses.</p>
			<p>The dotard wore an under-waistcoat close to his body, the dotardess used to dye her hair.</p>
			<p>The dotard took snuff, and went to take steam baths⁠—the dotardess ate sweets, and went to the Russian opera.</p>
			<p>Once the dotard went to the bath, steamed himself, steamed himself, and oversteamed himself, and died on the bench.</p>
			<p>The dotardess went to the opera, called encore to the singer, shouted and shouted. and overshouted herself, and died in the gallery.</p>
			<p>The old dotard and dotardess were buried.</p>
			<p>There is nothing to grieve about: there will always be dotards and dotardesses.</p>
