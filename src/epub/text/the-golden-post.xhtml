			<h2 epub:type="title">The Golden Post</h2>
			<p>Bobby was angry with his papa and said to his nurse:</p>
			<p>“As soon as I grow up I’ll get to be a general, and I’ll come to papa’s house with a cannon and take him prisoner and tie him up to a post.”</p>
			<p>Papa, overhearing, cried out:</p>
			<p>“Ah, you bad boy! Tie papa to a post, would you? That would hurt papa badly.”</p>
			<p>Bobby took fright, and said hesitatingly:</p>
			<p>“But, papa, you know it would be a golden post, with a bit of writing on it⁠—‘For Bravery.’ ”</p>
