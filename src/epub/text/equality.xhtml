			<h2 epub:type="title">Equality</h2>
			<p>A big fish overtook a little one and wanted to swallow him.</p>
			<p>The little fish squeaked out:</p>
			<p>“It is unjust. I also want to live. All fishes are equal before the law.”</p>
			<p>The big fish answered:</p>
			<p>“What’s the matter? I won’t discuss whether we are equal, but if you don’t want me to eat you, then do you please swallow me if you can⁠—swallow me, don’t be afraid, I shan’t set on you.”</p>
			<p>The little fish opened his mouth and poked about trying to get the big fish in, sighed at last and said:</p>
			<p>“You have it. Swallow me.”</p>
