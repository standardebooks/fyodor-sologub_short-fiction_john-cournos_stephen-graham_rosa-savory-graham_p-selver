			<h2 epub:type="title">They</h2>
			<p>We could see them if we liked to, though they are not at all as we are, and almost do not notice us. How indeed can we interest them?</p>
			<p>Once I caught sight of one.</p>
			<p>It was evening, and I was together with my sadness in the silent embrace of my walls.</p>
			<p>The minutes burned, because I did not yet know how to extinguish their consuming flame.</p>
			<p>And my reverie struggled helplessly on the yellow, shining boards of my floor.</p>
			<p>The objects importuned me, and I believed them.</p>
			<p>Then there was one brief moment⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p>Oh, if I could only find words to describe him!</p>
			<p>Everything visionary, everything habitual was lit up by his light, and departed from my attention⁠—and there fell on me his unspeakable glance.</p>
			<p>And answering my dread, he merely said to me:</p>
			<p>“Don’t be afraid.”</p>
			<p>Then again the time came on, and the objects once more bewitched me.</p>
