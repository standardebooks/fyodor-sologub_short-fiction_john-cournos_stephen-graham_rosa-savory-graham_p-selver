			<h2 epub:type="title">The Lump of Sugar</h2>
			<p>There was once a landlady. She had a little key to unlock a little cupboard. In the little cupboard was a little box, and in the little box was a wee wee lump of sugar.</p>
			<p>And the landlady had a little doggie, and the doggie was very capricious and liked to catch hold of the end of the landlady’s skirt and tug at it.</p>
			<p>The landlady took her little key and opened the little cupboard, found the little box and took out the wee wee lump of sugar. The little doggie looked up at her and wagged his tail.</p>
			<p>But the landlady said:</p>
			<p>“You tugged at my skirt, Capriza Petrovna, so see this little lump of sugar, well, you shan’t have it.”</p>
			<p>And she put the sugar back where it was before. The little doggie repented, yes, but it was too late.</p>
