			<h2 epub:type="title">Frogs</h2>
			<p>Two frogs met, one a little older, the other a little younger. Said the older: “Can you croak in other ways?”</p>
			<p>“Rather,” said the younger, “I should think I could.”</p>
			<p>“Then go ahead,” said the elder.</p>
			<p>The younger frog then began to croak in this way:</p>
			<p>“<i>Kva</i>⁠ ⁠… <i>kva</i>-<i>kva</i>⁠ ⁠…” and tried various tones, but the elder cried out:</p>
			<p>“Oh, ho, you’re only croaking Russian just the same.”</p>
			<p>“How else should I croak?” asked the younger.</p>
			<p>“Well in French for instance,” replied the elder.</p>
			<p>“No one croaks in French,” said the younger.</p>
			<p>“Yes they do,” said the elder.</p>
			<p>“Then you do it,” said the younger.</p>
			<p>“<i>Kvew</i>, <i>kvew</i>, <i>kvew</i>,” said the elder.</p>
			<p>“I can do that,” said the younger.</p>
			<p>“Go ahead, then,” said the elder.</p>
			<p>“<i>Kvee</i>, <i>kvee</i>, <i>kvee</i>,” said the younger one, trying.</p>
			<p>But the elder one laughed and cried out: “That sounds more like German than French, you with your <i>kvee</i>.”</p>
			<p>The younger one tried hard but couldn’t make <i>kvew</i>. Cried a little and then said:</p>
			<p>“Russian frogs croak better than French ones⁠—more clearly.”</p>
